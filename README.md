The majority of strokes will be brought on by an unanticipated obstruction of the courses that are being prompted by both the brain and the heart. Knowing the many warning signals of a stroke early on can help reduce the severity of the stroke. This research work proposes an early prediction of stroke diseases by using various machine learning approaches with the occurrence of hypertension, body mass index level, heart disease, average glucose level, smoking status, previous stroke, and age. The research was carried out by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).Using these high features attributes, four different classifiers have been trained Using ONEAPI , they are SVM,BernoulliNB,Random forest and XGboost

# The Need
A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.Earlier treatment results in a greater chance of recovery, a reduced likelihood of permanent disability and lesser need for extensive rehabilitation.Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is the system that is used to predict the diseases from the symptoms which are given by the patients or any user. The system processes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the output as the probability of the disease.

# Why ONEAPI

The grand idea behind oneAPI is to enable the use of one platform for a range of different hardware, hence developers would not have to use different languages, tools, and libraries when they code for CPUs and GPUs

# Results and discussion
It is evident that in the Random-forest performed well in data1 with an accuracy of 90.60%.Whereas the Xgboost,BernoulliNB and the SVM performed with an acuracy of 
82%,79% and 60%.The ONEAPI reduced the overall runtime and GPU usage significantly compared to normal platforms.
